This geo-visual map of Iran shows the utilization status of data centers in five key cities. In Tehran, the Ramezani data center operates at 46% capacity, and the Kazemian center at 41%. Esfahan’s data center is utilized at 61%, while Tabriz and Shiraz operate at 54% and 55%, respectively. Mashhad also runs at 41% utilization. These centers effectively manage high traffic and data volumes, ensuring smooth load distribution and robust network performance across Iran
Tehran hosts two major data centers: Ramezani, operating with a traffic rate of 491 Gb/s and a payload of 5.55 petabytes, handling fluctuations up to 700 Gb/s; and Kazemian, with a traffic rate of 279 Gb/s and a payload of 3.25 petabytes, peaking around 400 Gb/s. The Esfahan center processes 416 Gb/s with a 4.69 petabyte payload, peaking up to 600 Gb/s. Tabriz manages 323 Gb/s and 3.63 petabytes, with peaks reaching 500 Gb/s. Mashhad operates at 211 Gb/s, handling 2.58 petabytes, with traffic up to 300 Gb/s. Shiraz processes 341 Gb/s with a 3.95 petabyte payload, peaking at 500 Gb/s.

Performance monitoring: You're name is Ronaak. you are MCI NOC monitoring assistant, your task is describing NOC monitoring dashboards and answer related questions about NOC monitoring dashboards. This dashboard from MCI's NOC monitoring provides comprehensive insights into the performance metrics of data services, voice services, and SMS across different data centers. 

For data services, the dashboard reveals data delay times, with Tehran at 765 ms, Tabriz at 990 ms, Shiraz at 960 ms, and Mashhad at 936 ms. Trends in data delays from August 24 to September 17 show stable performance with occasional spikes up to 12,000 ms. It also displays DNS success rates, reflecting the percentage of successful DNS queries: Tehran at 97.6%, Esfahan at 97.0%, Tabriz at 96.0%, Shiraz at 96.7%, and Mashhad at 95.9%. A high DNS success rate is crucial for smooth access to websites and services.

In terms of voice services, the dashboard shows voice delay times: Tehran at 708 ms, Tabriz at 933 ms, Shiraz at 896 ms, and Mashhad at 874 ms. The accompanying graph highlights fluctuations from August 24 to September 20, with occasional spikes reaching around 5,000 ms, indicating network performance issues. Additionally, the voice success rates are noted, where Tehran, Tabriz, and Shiraz each achieve a 97% success rate, while Mashhad leads with 98%. 

Lastly, the dashboard includes essential SMS performance metrics, displaying success rates per center—Tehran at 99.1%, Tabriz at 99.0%, Shiraz at 99.2%, and Mashhad at 99.1%. The total SMS success rate also stands at 99.1%, highlighting overall service reliability. The lower section of the dashboard illustrates trends in daily Mobile Originated (MO) SMS counts, with notable volumes of 794 million and 1.19 billion over previous periods. 

Collectively, these metrics provide the NOC team in MCI with the necessary insights to monitor and enhance service performance, ensuring efficient operation and high user satisfaction across data, voice, and SMS services.  only answer in 2 line.

The voice traffic dashboard for MCI monitors usage across three network technologies: 2G, 3G, and 4G, using Erlangs as a unit of measurement to quantify voice traffic.

### 2G Voice Traffic:
The 2G network handled between 6 million to 8.8 million Erlangs over a 30-day period from August 24 to September 21. This data helps network operators assess 2G usage patterns, enabling them to adjust resources during peak times and maintain quality service while preventing congestion.

### 3G Voice Traffic:
The 3G network shows higher traffic, ranging from 10.5 million to 17.5 million Erlangs during the same period. This indicates a more active usage for voice calls, particularly in urban areas where 3G is prevalent. The higher volumes compared to 2G suggest that users are increasingly favoring 3G for voice communications.

### 4G Voice Traffic:
For the 4G network, which primarily supports data, voice traffic (known as VoLTE) tracked between 2 million and 3.6 million Erlangs. Although this volume is substantial, it remains lower than that of the 3G network, reflecting the trend that most 4G usage is data-oriented, with voice services still relying on 3G and 2G in certain areas. The 4G graph displays more fluctuations, indicating variability in VoLTE adoption and network load balancing.

Overall, these metrics are essential for the NOC team in MCI to monitor and optimize voice service performance across their network.

The Data Traffic chart provides a detailed view of the network's performance, enabling NOC operators to ensure optimal functionality and quickly address any potential overloads or issues based on real-time data. Over the last 48 hours, the monitor tracks both throughput and payload metrics, with the highest throughput reaching approximately 3.75 Tb/s and dipping below 1 Tb/s at its lowest. In the past 24 hours, the network processed a total data payload of 24.9 petabytes.
