The table provides a detailed log of incidents reported for MCI's network, including the type, severity, impacted services, resolution status, and time taken to resolve them.
Incident Resolution Status: This pie chart represents the Incident Resolution Status in the NOC (Network Operations Center), showing the proportion of incidents that are either Resolved or still In Progress.
1. Resolved (90.9%):
   - The majority of incidents (90.9%) have been resolved, indicating that the NOC is effective at addressing and closing issues. 
   - This shows the NOC's capability to quickly handle incidents and return systems or services to normal.

2. In Progress (9.1%):
   - A smaller portion (9.1%) of incidents are still in progress, meaning they are currently being worked on by the NOC team.
   - These may represent more complex issues that take longer to resolve or incidents that recently occurred.
Incident Count by Severity:This bar chart provides a clear view of the distribution of incidents by severity, with the majority being critical. It highlights where the NOC team’s focus is—on handling urgent network issues. The chart helps prioritize resources and attention toward resolving the most significant problems.- Critical Incidents: The high count of critical incidents suggests that the network has faced several severe problems that likely impacted major services such as voice, data, or SMS.
- Balanced Response: While the focus is on addressing critical issues, the team has also managed some high and medium-severity incidents.
- No Low-Severity Incidents: The absence of low-severity incidents suggests that the NOC's current workload is centered around more impactful network problems.
Impacted Services Frequency:This horizontal bar chart titled "Impacted Services Frequency" shows the frequency of various services including Voice, Data, SMS, Internet, and VoIP.
 have been impacted by incidents in the NOC (Network Operations Center).This chart provides a clear view of which services are most frequently impacted during incidents, with voice and data being the top affected services. It helps the NOC prioritize resources for handling incidents and improving reliability in the most impacted areas. The chart highlights the areas where incident resolution efforts need to be focused to minimize service disruptions
Incident Type and Time to Resolve:**Critical Incidents** (e.g., Network Outages and Fiber Cuts) tend to have fast resolution times, often resolved immediately or within minutes. This highlights the NOC’s strong focus on addressing outages affecting multiple services.
- High Latency and Signal Interference took the longest time to resolve, requiring 4 hours and 3 hours respectively, suggesting that these issues require more detailed investigation and troubleshooting.
- Quick Response: Some incidents, like Power Outage, Network Outage, and Fiber Cut, were resolved with no delay, reflecting the efficiency of the NOC in handling critical issues.

The voice traffic dashboard for MCI monitors usage across three network technologies: 2G, 3G, and 4G, using Erlangs as a unit of measurement to quantify voice traffic.

- 2G Voice Traffic:
The 2G network handled between 6 million to 8.8 million Erlang over a 30-day period from August 24 to September 21. This data helps network operators assess 2G usage patterns, enabling them to adjust resources during peak times and maintain quality service while preventing congestion.

- 3G Voice Traffic:
The 3G network shows higher traffic, ranging from 10.5 million to 17.5 million Erlang during the same period. This indicates a more active usage for voice calls, particularly in urban areas where 3G is prevalent. The higher volumes compared to 2G suggest that users are increasingly favoring 3G for voice communications.

- 4G Voice Traffic:
For the 4G network, which primarily supports data, voice traffic (known as VoLTE) tracked between 2 million and 3.6 million Erlangs. Although this volume is substantial, it remains lower than that of the 3G network, reflecting the trend that most 4G usage is data-oriented, with voice services still relying on 3G and 2G in certain areas. The 4G graph displays more fluctuations, indicating variability in VoLTE adoption and network load balancing.

Overall, these metrics are essential for the NOC team in MCI to monitor and optimize voice service performance across their network.

The Data Traffic chart provides a detailed view of the network's performance, enabling NOC operators to ensure optimal functionality and quickly address any potential overloads or issues based on real-time data. Over the last 48 hours, the monitor tracks both throughput and payload metrics, with the highest throughput reaching approximately 3.75 Tb/s and dipping below 1 Tb/s at its lowest. In the past 24 hours, the network processed a total data payload of 24.9 petabytes.
